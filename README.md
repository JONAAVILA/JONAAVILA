## About me 😎

Hello everyone!
Thank you for visiting me, I am from Buenos Aires, Argentina... entrepreneur, this is why I started this whole path. I have always been passionate about technology and mainly what I did is oriented towards design in general. My curiosity about how to know how web pages were built led me to delve deeper and deeper into the subject, until I started designing websites and building them in Wordpress for clients who hired me as a freelancer. As time went by and I always tried to improve myself in every job I did, I reached a point where I felt limited, that was the moment I decided to study as a web developer... now I know there are no limits 😎💪.
During this time of study, he explored different technologies... Javascript, React, React Native, among others. But these are the ones I have the most fun with 🤪.
